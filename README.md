# LSP-Editor

My first contribution to open source software was me fixing some small problem
in a syntax highlighter. After a decade and some change, I'm banging my head
against Vim plugins trying to figure out how I can get syntax highlighting,
diagnostics (static analysis, linters, etc), and auto-complete in my editor.

At the same time, I've noticed a family of pain points around the fact that
**code can be serialized as text, but that's not what it is**. The underlying
data structure are a graph, the syntax is [usually] a tree, but instead of
editing either of those we find ourselves editing bytes and lines (i.e. text).

I've started to wonder whether there's a unified solution to both problems,
and whether we can move past text editors to **semantic editors**, or at least
we can move a bit in that directoin.

Anyway, I've found myself wondering whether the [Language Server Protocol][lsp]
might be a worthwhile exploration. Most tools seem like they're [slowly]
starting to converge around this protocol (and its [index format][lsif]), and
it might be interesting to have a small software editor where all of the heavy
lifting is done by various language servers.

## Status

Not even close.

My first experiment: use [semantic tokens][semtok] to do some basic syntax
highlighting. My day basically went like this:

- Isn't `tsserver` a language server? I bet this will be easy.
- Oh... `tsserver` was invented before LSP, and doesn't support it.
- But there's a wrapper!
- But it's archived.
- But there's another wrapper!
- ...but `textDocument/semanticTokens` isn't available. :(
- Maybe there's some non-standard way to do it with `tsserver`?
- Nope, semantic tokens are mentioned in the Typescript source byt not exported.
- I'll make an issue: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/42091
- What else is likely to have a language server? Python?
- No `textDocument/semanticTokens` in that language server either.
- Rust? Grepping for `semanticTokens` doesn't look good.
- ...Go?! Oh wow, there's an [official language server][gopls]?!?!
- AND IT SUPPORTS `textDocument/semanticTokens` HALLELUJAH

TL;DR: A normal morning as a software engineer.

Anyway, working on Secure Scuttlebutt for years has made me [too] comfortable
with Node.js, so I banged out a quick JavaScript prototype that connects to
the language server, tells it where the `hello.go` file is, and then adds some
syntax highlighting. It's _very_ basic, and the paths are hard-coded.

It probably won't work for you.

## Try

...but if you want to try it anyway.

1. [Install gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/user.md#installation)
2. Install Node.js
3. `git clone` and `cd` into this directory.
4. `npm install` (only uses `chalk` library for HSV colors)
5. Edit the source or move `hello.go` to `/Users/christianbundy/Source/lsp-editor/hello.go`
6. `node index.js`

If you're very lucky, you might see something like this:
